// Raycaster is a Singleton class that works closesly with InputManager. When an input event is detected (click/press),
// a raycast is fired from the reticle in the center of the screen. Then, the Raycaster checks for objects that it collided
// with. Objects that are hit by the ray cast can be queried each frame using anythingHitByRay(), or getObjectHitByRay
// which returns null/false if nothing was hit this frame.
